            <p>Addendum: This page dynamically updates its content based
                on user interaction, mimicking a back-end serving system using
                JavaScript.The problem I solved in this project was implementing a bubble sort algorithm using JavaScript. The goal was to allow users to input a series of numbers and sort them in ascending order when a "Sort" button was clicked. To achieve this, I wrote a simple bubble sort function that iterates through the input numbers, compares them, and swaps them if necessary.his is repeated until the array is fully sorted. During development, I encountered difficulties with capturing the user input properly and ensuring that the numbers were sorted correctly. I initially faced issues when the input was not being parsed into numbers, as the default behavior would treat the input as a string. To solve this, I used JavaScript's `split()` method to separate the input by commas and `parseInt()` to convert each value into an integer. In addition to the sorting functionality, the page layout uses CSS Grid to create the Holy Grail layout, which is composed of a header, a menu sidebar, main content, an advertisement section, and a footer. The advertisement section includes a clickable image that leads to an Amazon page for the product. This project helped me practice both JavaScript and CSS Grid, reinforcing my understanding of both front-end programming and layout techniques.</p>
