                The process of creating this "Choose Your Own Adventure" game involved multiple steps, starting with a detailed plan of the story's flow. I used a flowchart to map out the different paths and possible endings, ensuring that each player's choice led to a logical conclusion. 
                In terms of implementation, the HTML structure was built to provide areas for the story, the choices, and the images. CSS was used to ensure the layout was clean and responsive, especially for mobile users. JavaScript was a key part of this project, allowing for dynamic updates based on the player's choices. Each stage of the story was represented as an object, with properties for text, choices, consequences, and images. 
                One challenge I encountered was working with local image paths. To resolve this, I moved all images to the project folder and used relative paths, ensuring compatibility when the project is hosted online. This project improved my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling, and I am confident in the final product's functionality and design.
